         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CHARACTER OF A Proteſtant Jeſuite.</head>
            <p>HE is a Perſon of a more exerciſed Faith than Underſtanding; one Governed by Inſtinct, not Intellect; and who (like thoſe of old) never think he has enough of the Deity; till he is beſide himſelf: You may call him if you pleaſe, a perpetual motion, or a reſtling whirligig, ever turning from bad to worſe; or the <hi>Ignis fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuus</hi> of Divinity, carried about with every Wind; leaſt conſidering, whence it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, or whither it goeth; as even ſuch likewiſe, is every one that is born of him. It may be thought, the Prophet had ſomewhat like him in his Eye, in that wheel (of his) within a wheel; for of himſelf he never was, but ill ſplit from another, like thoſe Imperfect, Dough-bak'd Creatures produced by the Sun on the Banks of <hi>Nile;</hi> ſo that his Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is Founded in Corruption, and his Extraction of the ſame Parentage with Monſters not intended, but produced. His Principles are like the Chaos; a confuſed lump of every thing and nothing; or a Gallimofry of Negatives; nor this, nor that, nor t'other, but what he is no man knows, no not the Angels in Heaven, nor himſelf to boot; this only excepted, that he is more Party-Colour'd than <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Coat; and patch'd together of more pieces than a Taylors Cuſhion. Nor is his Practice much unſuitable to his Principles; he puts on Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion as a <hi>Cloak,</hi> not a Garment; and Varniſhes his Impoſtures with Holineſs to the Lord. Thus <hi>Abſalom</hi> pretends a Sacrifice, when his buſineſs is Rebellion; and <hi>Herod</hi> a Worſhip, when his Deſign is Murther; nor with much wonder <hi>Machiavel</hi> the <hi>Florentine</hi> hath taught him; He that would gain by Deceit, muſt firſt acquire a Credit, by (at leaſt) a ſhew of Integrity; and he that would practiſe upon the People, muſt follow the old Rule of <hi>Finge Deum</hi>— Such Influence have ſolemn looks, and Verily, Verily, upon the Multitude, who have little elſe to paſs them for Men, but Speech and Figure: Hence it is that he puts off his Tinſel for Standard, and the Maggots of his own Brain for Divine Inſpiration; That he obtrudes his Enthuſiaſms for Viſions, and juſtifies <hi>Homer,</hi> that even ſuch Dreams are of God: That he takes a Holy Pride to himſelf, and ſays to the reſt of the World, Stand off: That he calls the common Infirmities of Mankind, Crying ſins, National Sins, Bow-dyed Sins; and his own Mormo's, but Slips, and Failings: That he can ſee no Sin <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Jacob,</hi> nor Iniquity in <hi>his Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> of God: That he calls them the only Holy, only Choſen, only Godly, only Precious, only Spiritually Diſcerning People: That he puts a diſcriminating <hi>Schibboleth</hi> on others; as Formaliſts, Carnaliſts, dry Moraliſts, wither'd Fig-trees, Out-ſide-men, Negative-Holineſs-men, <hi>Opus-operatum</hi>-men, Will-worſhippers, <hi>Laodiceans,</hi> and what not: That he talks of nothing but new Light, and Propheſie, Spiritual Incomes, In-dwellings, Emanations, Manifeſtations, Sealings, and the like Gibberiſh and Canting. To which alſo the zealous twang of the Noſe, adds no ſmall efficacy. That he Counter to all things <hi>in Power,</hi> and treads the <hi>Antipodes</hi> to every thing Commanded; and for no other reaſon, but becauſe Commanded: For it may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that the Lords Prayer was not ſo abſolutely thrown out of the Kirk, till recommended by its own Directory. In ſhort, That he calls Subjection in matters of Religion, a tying up the Spirit, and all Injunctions, even in things indifferent, a manifeſt invading the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum.</hi> And now the great Cry is, Perſecution for Conſcience; nothing in his mouth, but deſtitute, afflicted; and (the common Corrolary) <hi>but not forſaken.</hi> Alas, alas, the habitations of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> are ſwallow'd, and the places of the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> taken away: A Bow is bent againſt the Daughter of <hi>Judah,</hi> and the Breach of the Virgin of <hi>Sion</hi> is like a Sea. Whereas on the other hand, let him be but as in the Years paſt; and that Sun once more ſhine on his Tabernacle: This ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs new Models his Conſcience, and like (<hi>Aaron's</hi> Rod) he ſwollows up every thing that lies in his way: Even Princes muſt lay their hands on their mouths; and the Nobles ſpeak not again to his words: The Poor Diſtreſſed is become <hi>Hogan Mogan,</hi> and the <hi>Servus Servorum, Dominus Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minantium:</hi> The little Flock claims a Kingdom <hi>in condigno,</hi> and the choſen Generation ſets up for a Royal Prieſt-hood. In ſhort, this little Horn takes a Mouth to himſelf ſpeaking mighty things, and his Language is, Overturn, Overturn, Overturn. And now he makes his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine ſuitable to his Text, and owns above-board, that Dominion is founded in Grace, not Nature: That the Goods of this World, are properly the Elects: That himſelf and his <hi>Knipper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolings,</hi> are the only <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and all the reſt <hi>Aegyptians:</hi> That the New <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> muſt be propagated, as the ſecond Temple was built, with the Sword in one hand, and the Trowel in
<pb facs="tcp:50401:2"/>t'other; or as the Abbot (in <hi>Hen.</hi> 3<hi>ds.</hi> time) gave it in Abſolution to the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter, Gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum ſpiritualem ſine gladio materiali nihil poſſe.</hi> What ſhall I add? He declares that <hi>Quis ſuſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabit eum?</hi> was perſonally meant of his Tribe: And yet this man has his Followers, and theſe of the Honourable Women too, not a few; for (to ſay truth) his Converſation is much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the rate of that before the Flood; the Sons of God among the Daughters of Men: Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in all places, whether true or falſe, being moſt Natural to that Sex. 'Twas the Devils Policy to our firſt Parents, for well he knew that to beguile <hi>Eve,</hi> was the ready way to hook in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.</hi> And thus he proves a Stumbling-block to the Wives; and a Rock of Offence to the Husbands. In brief, like the Dragon in the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> his Tail draws a third part of the Stars, and caſts them to the Earth, the Reaſon is obvious, <hi>Fortitudo ejus in lumbis ejus, &amp; virtus, umbilico ventris.</hi> But to proceed, his Profeſſion is like his Allegiance, a meer <hi>(Fucus)</hi> yet, ſo well laid on, one (at firſt ſight) could not but ſwear 'twere Natural. His Common-place, <hi>Polyamhea,</hi> and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordance; and the height of his School-Divinity, is the Aſſemblies Catechiſm: His Prayer, a Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſody of Holy Hickops, Sanctified Barkings, Illuminated Goggles, Sighs, Sobs, Yexes, Gaſps, and Groans, not more intelligible than nauſeous. However (to give him his due) he Prays moſt hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily for the King, but with more Diſtinctions and Mental-Reſervations, than an Honeſt Man would have in taking the Covenant. From hence (as out of the third Heaven) he falls by Head and Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders into his Preachment; which what other is it, than a wild career over Hill and Dale, till the After-noon Chimes ſtop him; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> thump upon thump, yelp upon yelp, doctrine upon doctrine, rule upon rule, reaſon upon reaſon, text upon text, proof upon proof, direction upon direction, motive upon motive, sign upon sign, token upon token, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little, effect upon effect, and uſes more than innumerable; and here likewiſe he cries up obedience to magiſtrates, but with ſuch a <hi>Salva gloria Dei,</hi> that he had better let it alone: as alſo that they ought to be defended by their Subjects; in defence never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs of the true Religion, of which himſelf muſt be Judge. And for his Grace at Meat, what can I better compare it to, than a <hi>Canterbury Rack,</hi> half pace, half gallop; ſo his, an odd hobbling ſhuffling, between a Grace and a Prayer, and a Prayer and a Grace. Laſtly, as to his Vertues, (for it cannot be denied, but he has ſomewhat of that which <hi>Tully</hi> calls, <hi>adumbrata virtutum ſpecimina)</hi> I wiſh it might be ſaid of them, that they were other than Mask'd Hypocriſie, the Poet hit it:
<q>
                  <l>Da Justum Sanctumque videri,</l>
                  <l>Noctem peccatis, &amp; fraudibus objice nubem.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And like an apt Scholar, he has gotten his Leſſon by Heart, and can wrap the <hi>Philiſtin</hi>'s Sword in an Holy Ephod; from whence elſe is it, that he call crave a Bleſſing to the Deſign, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo Ungodly; and give thanks for the Succeſs, be it never ſo Wicked: That he will not ſwear, but can diſpenſe with the profitable ſin of lying: That he will not be Drunk (to be ſeen of men) but yet can take a Brotherly Carouſe in a Corner: That he walk as if he had made a Covenant with his eyes, and yet <hi>ſi uxor non vult aut non ſi poſſit, veniat ancilla,</hi> is wholeſome Doctrine with him: That he is a zealous obſerver of the Sabbath, and yet can make leſs Conſcience of Schiſm than a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice: That he cries, <hi>Vae mihi ſi non Evangelizavero:</hi> and yet allows no impoſition of Hands, but broken Pates: That he abhors Idols, and yet can commit Sacrilege? which, what is it, than to burn the Idol with a Coal from the Altar; That he exhorts (the Beloved) to Conſtancy under Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution; and yet, come what will, he can lick himſelf ſo whole, 'twill be hard to tell where he had been hurt. In ſhort, that he is a perfect <hi>Samaritan,</hi> for let the <hi>Gentiles</hi> prevail, and he is of the race of <hi>Iſhmael;</hi> and let the <hi>Jews</hi> get the upper hand, he had <hi>Abraham</hi> to his Father. To conclude, he is a Glo-worm that ſhines beſt in the night of Ignorance; One whoſe Faith has eaten up his Charity: One that has torn the Seamleſs Coat into Raggs, and tack'd them together to cover his Nakedneſs: One that having forſaken the Fountain, has hewed to himſelf but broken Ciſterns: One that ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows all things unchewed, and brings them up again as raw and undigeſted: One whoſe eyes are at the ends of the Earth, and yet would be thought not to miſtake his way. In ſhort, one that has an excuſe for every thing that he ſhould not do, and a <hi>Salvo</hi> for every thing he ſhould do: and all this by Scripture; <hi>Adeo nihil eſt quod S. Scriptura Torqueri non poſſis, modo Torqueatur.</hi> In a word, he is one of whom it may be ſaid, as <hi>Heraclius</hi> of the Bow, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; and but that I find him ſo well cut out by <hi>Horace,</hi> I had not yet taken off my hand from ſo everlaſting an Argument.
